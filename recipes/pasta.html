    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Of all the classic pasta dishes, few are as deceptively simple or as
      richly satisfying as a well-made carbonara. At its heart, it's a beautiful
      alchemy of just a few key ingredients: hot, al dente pasta tossed
      vigorously with raw eggs, a generous amount of sharp Pecorino Romano
      cheese, and crispy cubes of guanciale. The residual heat from the pasta
      gently cooks the eggs into a smooth, creamy sauce that clings to every
      strand without the need for any actual cream. Finished with a heavy crack
      of black pepper, the final dish is a perfect balance of salty, savory, and
      peppery flavors, creating a comforting and deeply luxurious meal.
