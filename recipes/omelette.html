    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The key to a perfect French omelette is low, gentle heat and constant,
      swift motion. Whisked eggs are poured into a generously buttered pan and
      agitated continuously with a fork to create small, soft curds throughout.
      Just before set, the omelette is rolled neatly into a tight oval or folded
      into thirds, resulting in a tender, slightly runny interior encased in a
      smooth, pale yellow exterior with no visible browning. It is a masterclass
      in technique, celebrating the pure, rich flavor of eggs and butter.
